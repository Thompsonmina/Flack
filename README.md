# Project 2

## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### Flack

As tasked by the project I created a simple messaging service, reminescent of slack, that allows for real time communication between users in channels(chatrrooms).

 In the project folder, I have my templates directory, which contains the 4 html files used for the project. The static directory contains 1 js script, 1 css file and an icon. Then i have my applications.py which is the main python file and chatsobjects.py which contains the custom classes i use to represent channels and chats.Finally we have the requirements.txt.

 The personal touch i chose to add to my app was the private channel functional(sort of like a group chat). Every user has to ability to create a private channel and add other users that have been registered in the app to it. So the private channel is only displayed to the users in it.
